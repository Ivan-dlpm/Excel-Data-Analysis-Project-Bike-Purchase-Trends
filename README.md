<h1>Excel Data Analysis Project: Bike Purchase Trends</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
For this project, I built an interactive Excel dashboard from a bike-buyers dataset by performing full data cleaning, feature creation, and visualization tasks. I began by removing duplicates, standardizing categorical values (e.g., converting coded gender and marital status labels into readable text), and creating new analytical fields such as age brackets using nested IF statements. After preparing the data, I constructed multiple pivot tables to analyze customer behavior—examining how income, commute distance, and age groups relate to bike-purchasing decisions. I then transformed these pivot tables into clear visual charts, customized number formats, and ensured consistent design across the dashboard. To make the dashboard dynamic, I added slicers for marital status, region, and education level, enabling multi-level filtering and interactive exploration of customer segments. The final result was a polished, well-structured Excel dashboard that provides quick, actionable insights into which demographic groups are most likely to purchase a bike.
